# VERDE: Vast Exploration and Research in Dry Forest Ecosystems

Welcome to the **VERDE** repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project is!
We propose Vast Exploration and Research in Dry Forest Ecosystems (VERDE), a working group **to harness environmental data science for understanding the evolutionary past and probable futures of a globally distributed and threatened biome: tropical dry forests**. Tropical dry forests are defined by drought deciduousness which determines ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling. However, the origins of deciduousness, its degree of variation, and its role in determining the impacts of climate change in tropical dry forests are unclear. To understand the evolutionary history, contemporary biogeography, and probable futures of dry forests, we propose three research goals to examine the distribution of deciduousness:

* Investigate evolutionary past and origins of tropical deciduousness.
* Study the definition of deciduosness in tropical taxa and its degree of variation.
* Measure the sensitivity of tropical dry forests to climate variability with remote sensing and modeling tools.

We will achieve this by bringing together datasets that include phylogenetic trees, functional traits, field-based phenology data, remote sensing imagery, and ecosystem modeling. Importantly, our working group will broaden the century-old and geographically biased ‘temperate phenology paradigm’ by identifying past, present, and future determinants of tropical phenological variation. Our team is deliberately diverse, representing a spectrum of career stages, geography, and disciplines like ecophysiology, ecology, ecosystem science, macroevolution, forecasting, and remote sensing.

## Code Repository

This section of the repository will include all the code developed for the project. You can structure it as follows:

- **Analysis Code**: Scripts for data analysis, statistical modeling, etc.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts for cleaning, merging, and managing datasets.
- **Visualization**: Code for creating figures, charts, and interactive visualizations.

## Meeting Notes and Agendas

Meeting notes and agendas will be regularly updated here to keep all group members informed and engaged with the progress and direction of the project.

## Contributing to This Repository

We welcome contributions from all group members. To maintain the quality and integrity of the repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Make sure all commits have a clear and concise message.
- Document any major changes or decisions in the meeting notes.
- Review and merge changes through pull requests to ensure oversight.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions about how to contribute, please refer to the [ESIIL Support Page](https://esiil.org/support) or contact the repository maintainers directly.

## Customize Your Repository

As a new working group, you'll want to make this repository your own. Here's how to get started:

1. **Edit This Readme**: Replace the placeholder content with information about your specific project. Ensure that the introduction, project overview, and objectives clearly reflect your group's research focus.

2. **Update Group Member Bios**: Add details about each group member's expertise, role in the project, and professional background. Include links to personal or professional web pages to foster community engagement and collaboration.

3. **Organize Your Code**: Structure your codebase in a way that is logical and accessible. Use directories and clear naming conventions to make it easy for all members to find and contribute to different parts of the project.

4. **Document Your Data**: Include a data directory with README files explaining the datasets, sources, and any preprocessing steps. This will help new members understand and work with the project's data effectively.

5. **Outline Your Methods**: Create a detailed METHODS.md file where you describe the methodologies, software, and tools you will be using in your research. This transparency will support reproducibility and collaborative development.

6. **Set Up Project Management**: Utilize the 'Issues' and 'Projects' features on GitHub to track tasks, discuss ideas, and manage your workflow. This can help in maintaining a clear view of progress and priorities.

7. **Add a License**: Choose and include an appropriate open-source license for your project, ensuring that the broader community understands how they can use and contribute to your work.

8. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Establish a CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for members on how to propose changes, submit issues, and contribute code.

9. **Review and Merge Workflow**: Decide on a workflow for reviewing and merging changes. Will you use branch protection? Who will have merge privileges? Document this process to avoid confusion.

10. **Establish Communication Channels**: Beyond GitHub, set up additional communication channels like Slack, Discord, or email lists for quick and informal discussions.

Remember, the goal is to make your repository clear, accessible, and useful for all current and future members of your working group. Happy researching!
